<h1> Marketing campaign </h1>
<h3>In 1972, Sunil Dutt launched a campaign to promote India as a<br> popular tourist destination.[3] The phrase "Incredible India" was<br> adopted as a slogan by the ministry. Before 2002, the Indian
government had regularly formulated policies and prepared pamphlets 
and brochures for the promotion of tourism, however, it had not<br> supported tourism in a concerted fashion. In 2002, the tourism
ministry made a conscious effort to bring in more professionalism
in its attempts to promote tourism. It formulated an integrated<br> communication strategy with the aim of promoting India as a 
destination of choice for the discerning traveller. The tourism
ministry engaged the services of advertising and marketing firm
Ogilvy and Mather(O and M) India to create a new campaign to
increase tourist inflows into the country.</h3>

<h1> Impact on Indian tourism </h1>
<h3> According to spending data released by Visa Asia Pacific in <br>March 2006, India has emerged as the fastest growing market<br> in the Asia-Pacific region in terms of international tourist spending.<br> The data revealed that international tourists spent US$372 million <br>in India in the fourth quarter (Octoberâ€“December) of 2005,
25% more than in the fourth quarter of 2004. China, which came 
second in the region, managed to raise US$784 million from 
international tourism in Q4 2005, a growth of 23% over its
Q4 2004 figures. The tourist spending figures for India would
have satisfied the Indian tourism ministry, which had been
targeting the high-end market through its long running Incredible
India communication campaign.[9]</h3>


<h1> Reception </h1>
<h3>Indian travel industry analysts and tour operators were
appreciative of the high standards of the Incredible India
campaign. "The promo campaign is making a powerful visual
impact and creating a perception of India being a magical
place to visit," said Anne Morgaon Scully, President, McCabe
Bremer Travel, Virginia, U.S. Average travelers too appeared
to find the campaign interesting and informative, going by
favourable comments on blogs on travel websites. Although
Incredible India was generally well received, industry 
observers differed in their opinions on the positioning of
India in the campaign. G.S.Murari, Director, Fidelis Advertising 
and Marketing Private Ltd. stated that he was uncomfortable
with the tagline "Incredible India" and was of the opinion that
since India was not a uni-dimensional country like Singapore or
the Maldives, using a word like 'incredible' to describe India
as a whole was not appropriate. </h3>
